# turtle-game-python
The game begins by asking the user for a bet amount and a turtle to bet on out of five.
The game then begins. The program first draws the starting and finishing line, then initialize the turtles and stop for some time.
Then race is started. The program moves the turtles forward randomly and keep tracks for winners.
The user is given $100 at the beginning and 
program  keeps track of the total earnings of the player as long as the user bets another round.
The winnings can be calculated by the following formula:
  winnings = [ ( number of turtles (which is 5) / finishing place ) × bet amount ]
In an example with five turtles, if the user bets $20, picks turtle 1, and the turtle finishes second, then:
  winnings = [ ( 5 / 2 ) × 20 ] = 50
